        We no longer need to use reduced data, as we have already cleaned the data, so no need to split it up
        -DO NOT HARDCODE ANY VALUES, previous iteration had hardcoded python splits [:xxx], this is not dynamic, and isnt something we want, so from now 
        on we will use the split method off the keras documentation:
        https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/

        Different, should use early stopping, nth number of epochs

        Hyperparamater Tuning as well needs to be implemented

        Current Issues 10/23
        1. Could not convert string to float 'SI' Error, might need to convert all text data to a 
            number sibling (ex. pitch_type, 1 = Fastball, 2= Curveball, etc.)
            //Possible Solution - One hot encoding
        2. Issues with missing values
            //Solved - Dropped missing values from reduced data set (in other words, we did not 
            drop values from the large data set, but we did drop values from the reduced data set)
        3. Added in Dictionary to select features more quickly
            //Solved - Added in Dictionary to select features more quickly
        4. Added in Label Encoder
            //Solved - Added in Label Encoder (label enconder changed the range from [0,13) to [0, classes-1] and shifted each class down 1 value)
