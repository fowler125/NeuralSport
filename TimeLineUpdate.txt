This file is meant to keep an up to date list of bugs/fixes, issues and new features to add in. Similar to feature request, and radars

Name:Jabari Fowler
Updated: 10/25/2024

Bugs:
-None at the moment, however there may be a possible issue with the dataCleaner.py file for splitting. Since we split the data into X-Axis and y-Axis
we removed the rows after the splitting happen, a possible solution will be to remove the empty cells before the split happens
and then go ahead and split the data.

Issue Fixes:
-None at the time

Feature addition timelines:
Pitcher Model  --> Completed (10/23)
Add in Hyperparameter Tuning ---> Finish by (11/1)
Add in Correlation Matrix and Confusion Matrix (Rob) ---> Finish by (11/1)


Updates: 10/26/2024

Notes: We will be in the process of moving all the code notes, out of the code and into its own seperate documentation directory,
which should help for better documentation for the project, as the notes will become to large and too lengthy to reference
inside the code.



        param :: self
        We no longer need to use reduced data, as we have already cleaned the data, so no need to split it up
        -DO NOT HARDCODE ANY VALUES, previous iteration had hardcoded python splits [:xxx], this is not dynamic, and isnt something we want, so from now 
        on we will use the split method off the keras documentation:
        https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/

        Different, should use early stopping, nth number of epochs

        Hyperparamater Tuning as well needs to be implemented

        Current Issues 10/23
        1. Could not convert string to float 'SI' Error, might need to convert all text data to a 
            number sibling (ex. pitch_type, 1 = Fastball, 2= Curveball, etc.)
            //Possible Solution - One hot encoding
        2. Issues with missing values
            //Solved - Dropped missing values from reduced data set (in other words, we did not 
            drop values from the large data set, but we did drop values from the reduced data set)
        3. Added in Dictionary to select features more quickly
            //Solved - Added in Dictionary to select features more quickly
        4. Added in Label Encoder
            //Solved - Added in Label Encoder (label enconder changed the range from [0,13) to [0, classes-1] and shifted each class down 1 value)
